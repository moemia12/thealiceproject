// 1% of alocohol is 0.35g of alcohol
// To translate volume (e.g. ml) to mass (e.g. g) and vice versa, it is necessary to know the density. Alcohol density d=0.8g/ml. 
// Thus: a wine at 12.5 % vol contains 12.5ml of alcohol/100ml of wine x 0.8 g/ml = 10g of alcohol/100 ml of wine. This is the equivalent of 1 drinking unit (= 10 g).
